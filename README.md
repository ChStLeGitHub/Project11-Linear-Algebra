# Project 11: Linear Algebra
 
**Objective:** To leverage linear regression analysis, data scaling techniques, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms, and linear algebra to assist Sure Tomorrow insurance company with customer segmentation, benefits prediction, and data privacy protection.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Exploratory data analysis, modeling with linear regressions, model evaluation (F1 score, root-mean-square error, and coefficient of determination), data scaling (MaxAbsScaler), K nearest neighbors (KNN), linear algebra, data obfuscation, and mathematical proof
